.SH NAME
cptobackup \- creates a time-stamped copy of files, dirs ...

mvtobackup \- moves to a time-stamped rename of files, dirs ...
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cptobackup
.RI "[--backdir] " files | dir " [ ..." files | dir "... ]"

.B cptobackup
.RI "[--help | --version]"

.B mvtobackup
.RI "[--backdir] " files | dir " [ ..." files | dir "... ]"

.B mvtobackup
.RI "[--help | --version]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
For each file or folder listed as argument,
.B cptobackup
performs a
.B cp -a
or
.B mv
to a time-stamped destination in the same location folder as the source, unless a
.I .mvtobackup
folder exists at the same level as the source.

When a
.I .mvtobackup
folder is at the same level as some source, the time-stamped copy/move is targeted into it.
This prevents visible pollution, though this may lead to not-very-visible
disk-space consumption ...

.SH OPTIONS
.SS 
.RI "--backdir
attempts to create a
.I .mvtobackup
folder in current directory, stops if it fails or continues regular behaviour described above.
(pay attention that the folder-level of targets must be at the same level of an existing
.I .mvtobackup
folder, thus, targets in other directory than the current won't end in
.IR ./.mvtobackup )
.SS
.RI "--version"
reports
.BR cptobackup " or " mvtobackup
version.
.SS
.RI "--help"
reports short
.BR cptobackup "'s or " mvtobackup "'s"
usage.
.SH OUTPUT
all performed operations are duly output to state things clear.
.SH RETURNED VALUES
.BR cptobackup " or " mvtobackup " return " 1
if any error occured, though they usually try to go to the end of argument list.
they return
.B 0
for success without any failure.
.SH SEE ALSO
.RB "(1)" "cp" ", (1)" mv
