.SH NAME
bozoconf \- triggers some regular "./configure.sh" if available, if not it will try to build one via autoall(1) before launching it
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
bozoconf
.RI "[ --track-changes ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bozoconf
tries to find a 
.I ./configure.sh
script ; if it is missing,
.B bozoconf
attempts to build one via the
.B autoall(1)
utility.

.B bozoconf
may inherits several environment variables in order to efficiently build into alternates trees, cross-compile, or use alternative build environments.

.SH OPTIONS

reports
.B bozoconf
version, and also versions from all sub-called utilities.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.SS
.BR $OURBUILDDIR " and " $OURSOURCDIR
sets separate build-dir and source-dir, typically :

.RI OURBUILDDIR= targetdir " OURSOURCDIR=`" pwd "` bozoconf"

in the source dir does the trick ...
.SS
.B $BOZOCONFCACHE
sets
.I ./configure.sh
--cache-file= option in order to speed configurations.
.SS
.B $BOZOCONFMAKE
uses an altername
.B make
build utility, mainly relevant for cross compiling and such.
.SS
.B $BOZOCONFTARGET
sets a default
.B make
target, usefull when called from a GUI.
.SS
.B $BOZOMAKEEXT
obscure ... probably in order to get compile logs separated ?
.SH FILES
.B bozoconf
builds a
.I .vim.prepend
file in order to map the F12 key to the proper build operation.
