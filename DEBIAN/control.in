Description: various utils such as backup-timestamping or autobuild a libtooled tree
 provides :
   scramble    reads an amount of lines and output them in random order
   autoall     goes from libtoolize through aclocal, autoheader, automake to
               autoconf
   countsort   counts the number of identical subsequent lines in on stdin
   percent     after a countsort, reorders the output and computes percents
   cptobackup  copies a time-stamped backup of a file or folder
   vimall      build tags, opens all sources in a tree into vim buffers
   mvtobackup  moves to a time-samped file or folder
   bozoconf    goes from a naked libtooled tree to a configured source tree
   rev         reverses each input line the other way round
   repozclean  performs a huge cleanup of a libtooled tree for repository
               checking
   maketags    builds tags form a libtooled tree
   revtail     outputs a file line by line starting from the last line
