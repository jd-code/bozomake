 timestamping to scripts for autobuilding a libtooled source tree.

   countsort, counts the number of identical subsequent lines in on stdin
   percent, after a countsort, reorders the output and computes percents
   cptobackup, copies a time-stamped backup of a file or folder
   vimall, build tags, opens all sources in a tree into vim buffers
   mvtobackup, moves to a time-samped file or folder
   bozoconf, goes from a naked libtooled tree to a configured source tree
   rev, reverses each input line the other way round
   repozclean, performs a huge cleanup of a libtooled tree for repository checking
   maketags, builds tags form a libtooled tree
